#### [v1.4.4] â€” 2017-03-01

### Developers
The developer should pay particular attention to the development and integration of a new module within a library. 

#### Quick start

Clone project

    git clone git+ssh://git@module.kopaxgroup.com:20024/agd/module-rollup.git
    

Initialize git config project (change ssh url if needed)

    rm -rf .git && git init && git remote add origin ssh://git@module.kopaxgroup.com:20024/agd/module-rollup.git
    
Initialize package.json (change key "name" value in package.json before use, it will add new name instead of last one in other key using "name" value)
    
    cd config
    node initJson.js
    

#### Main commands:

Install dependencies

    npm install

Build the dist and lib folders

    npm run build
    
Test with eslint and jest

    npm run test
    

#### Tool commands: 

Generate Readme page

1/ Install Node Bootstrap Readme Docs:


    npm install -g readme-docs
    
2/ Generate Readme build in your folder containing Readme.md, it will generate automaticaly a new build folder with exportable readme page.


    readme-docs
    
3/ Export your page on dedicated github pages  



### Bring up to date

Git structure of this module library allow to update main dependencies from master branch, these represent the major update each sub-project need to have in order to stay sustainable. Please refer to abstraction level list below before any update.

#### Level abstraction:
This module sample is constitued of different abstraction level
- level 0 : git branch master (init project)
- level 1 : git branch es6 (es6 code with internal dependencies)
- level 2 : git branch react (es6 and react jsx code with/without internal and external dependencies)

#### Main dev dependencies
Find below a quick list of package.json dependencies you have to maintain in priority (not exhaustive list of package.json dependencies)

- Level O - branch master
    Transpilation (Pay special attention to babel-cli and babel-core, also check other plugins babel and dependency regularly)

        - babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread
        - babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types
        - babel-preset-env
    
    Linting & Testing (Enzyme, jest, lint and eslint are required according to the TDD process, regularly check their dependencies)
        - enzyme
        - jest
        - lint-staged
        - pre-commit
        - eslint

    Other
        - jsdom
        - rimraf
        
        
### Extend module library
Rollup is dedied to maintain and improve library where webpack are for build and improve standard and web application.
Different from the development of an application a library must be thought in order to provide working code to users.

- Level 1 - branch es6
        
- Level 2 - branch react
    Transpilation 
        - babel-preset-react
        
    Linting & Testing
        - eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
